**Introduction**

The Flask KYC web application allows users to authenticate using their Google accounts and store KYC information. JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are utilized to secure API endpoints, ensuring only authenticated users can access their KYC data. The application is designed with containerization in mind, using Docker to create a portable, consistent environment.


**Application Components**
The application is built using the following technologies:

*Flask: A lightweight Python web framework

*Flask-PyMongo: A Flask extension that simplifies working with MongoDB

*Flask-OAuthlib: A Flask extension that provides OAuth 2.0 support

*Flask-JWT-Extended: A Flask extension that enables JWT-based authentication and access control

*MongoDB: A NoSQL database used to store user and KYC data

*Docker: A containerization platform that packages the application and its dependencies


**Installation and Setup**

1.Install Docker on your machine.

2.Clone the repository containing the application code.

3.Navigate to the project directory and build the Docker image using the following command:

*docker build -t flask-kyc-app .*

4. Run the Docker container using the following command:

*docker run -p 5000:5000 flask-kyc-app*

The application will be accessible at http://localhost:5000.


**API Endpoints**

The application provides the following API endpoints:

1. /: Redirects to the /login endpoint.

2. /login: Initiates the Google OAuth authentication process.

3. /login/authorized: Handles the Google OAuth callback and generates a JWT access token upon successful authentication.

4./kyc (POST): Adds KYC data for the authenticated user. Requires a JWT access token.

5./kyc (GET): Retrieves the KYC data for the authenticated user. Requires a JWT access token.


**Security Considerations**

It is essential to note that the provided application code contains sensitive information such as secret keys and OAuth credentials. These values should be stored in environment variables or separate configuration files to maintain security best practices. Additionally, proper error handling and input validation should be implemented to enhance the application's robustness and security.

**Conclusion**

The Flask KYC web application is a well-structured, functional solution for managing user authentication via Google OAuth and storing KYC data in a MongoDB database. With some improvements in security practices, error handling, and input validation, this application would be great starting point for MVP products.
